        <h1 className='text-4xl font-bold'>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>

        <p className='my-3'>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental part of web development, serving as a powerful language used to define and control the visual presentation of documents authored in HTML and other markup languages. It plays a pivotal role in transforming plain, unstyled web content into visually appealing and engaging web pages.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          CSS empowers web developers to style web pages with precision, enabling control over various design elements such as fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and animations. The term "cascading" in CSS signifies that when multiple styles are applied to an element, they are prioritized and applied in a specific order. This prioritization is defined by a hierarchy that considers inline styles, internal styles, and external stylesheets, ensuring a structured approach to styling web content.
        </p>

        <p className='my-5'>
          Types of CSS:
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          <strong>1. Inline CSS:</strong> Inline CSS involves applying styles directly to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute. For example:
          <br />
          <code>
            {'<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a blue text with a font size of 16px.</p>'}
          </code>
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          <strong>2. Internal CSS: </strong> lInternal CSS is placed within a {'<style>'} tag in the {'<head>'} section of an HTML document. It applies styles to the entire page or specific elements. Example:
          <br />
          <code>
            {`
              <!DOCTYPE html>
              <html>
              <head>
                  <style>
                      p {
                          color: blue;
                          font-size: 16px;
                      }
                  </style>
              </head>
              <body>
                  <p>This is a blue text with a font size of 16px.</p>
              </body>
              </html>
            `}
          </code>
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          <strong>3. External CSS: `</strong>` External CSS involves creating a separate .css file and linking it to the HTML document using the {`<link>`} tag. This method is widely used for larger projects and promotes maintainability. Example:
          <br />
          <code>
            {`
              <!DOCTYPE html>
              <html>
              <head>
                  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"/>
              </head>
              <body>
                  <p>This is a blue text with a font size of 16px.</p>
              </body>
              </html>
            `}
          </code>
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          <strong>4. Applying CSS to HTML:</strong> To apply CSS to HTML, you can use various methods, as shown above. Typically, you define your styles in a separate CSS file and link it to your HTML file using the {`<link>`} tag. You can also use inline styles by adding a `style` attribute to HTML elements or use internal styles within a {'<style>'} tag in the {'<head>'} section of your HTML document.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          <strong>5. CSS Selectors:</strong> CSS allows you to target HTML elements using selectors. For example, to style all paragraphs, you can use the selector `p`. To target elements with a specific class, you can use `.classname`, and to target elements with a specific ID, you can use `#elementID`.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          <strong>6. Cascading Order:</strong> The "cascading" aspect of CSS refers to the order in which styles are applied. Inline styles have the highest specificity, followed by internal styles and then external stylesheets. Specificity, importance, and source order also affect the cascading order.
        </p>

        <p className='my-5'>
          In summary, CSS is an indispensable tool in web development. It empowers developers to define and refine the visual aspects of web content, ultimately enhancing the user experience. By mastering CSS, web developers can create responsive, visually appealing, and accessible websites that cater to a diverse range of user preferences and devices.

        <h1 className='text-4xl font-bold'>CSS Layout: Crafting Structured Web Designs</h1>

        <p className='my-3'>
          The layout is a crucial aspect of web design that involves arranging and positioning elements on a web page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) plays a central role in defining the layout of web content. Understanding CSS layout principles is essential for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>Key Concepts:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          **1. Box Model:** The CSS box model is foundational to layout. It defines how elements are rendered, including their content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is essential for precise element positioning.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          **2. Display Property:** The `display` property determines how elements behave in the layout. Common values include `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and more. Block-level elements stack vertically, while inline elements flow horizontally within text.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          **3. Positioning:** CSS offers various positioning options, such as `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`. These options control how elements are placed within their containing elements or the viewport.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          **4. Floats:** The `float` property allows elements to float to the left or right within their container. Floating elements are often used for creating multi-column layouts.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          **5. Flexbox:** Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a powerful layout model that simplifies the creation of flexible and responsive designs. It offers precise control over element alignment and distribution within a container.
        </p>

        <h1 className='text-4xl font-bold'>CSS Selectors: Precision in Styling Web Elements</h1>

        <p className='my-3'>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) selectors are the building blocks of web styling. They allow you to precisely target and style individual or groups of HTML elements. Mastering CSS selectors is essential for creating well-structured and visually appealing web designs. Let's explore various types of selectors and their applications in detail.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>1. Type Selectors:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Type selectors target HTML elements based on their tag names. For example, to style all {`<p>`} elements on a page, you would use:
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'p {'}<br />
            {'  /* Your styles here */'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>2. Class Selectors:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Class selectors are prefixed with a dot (`.`) and target elements with a specific class attribute. They allow you to style elements with a shared class name. For example:
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'.btn {'}<br />
            {'  /* Your button styles here */'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p className='my-3'>
          To apply the `.btn` styles to an HTML element, you would add the `class` attribute with the value `btn` to that element.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>3. ID Selectors:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          ID selectors are prefixed with a hash (`#`) and target a single HTML element with a specific `id` attribute. IDs must be unique on a page. For example:
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'#header {'}<br />
            {'  /* Your header styles here */'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p className='my-3'>
          While IDs provide a high level of specificity, they should be used sparingly to maintain clean and maintainable code.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>4. Descendant Selectors:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Descendant selectors target elements that are descendants of a specific element. They use a space to separate the parent and descendant elements. For example, to style all {`<a>`} elements within a {`<nav>`} element:
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'nav a {'}<br />
            {'  /* Your navigation link styles here */'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>5. Child Selectors:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Child selectors, denoted by the {`>`} symbol, target elements that are direct children of a specific parent element. They provide a more specific way to select elements. For example, to style only the direct {`<li>`} children of a {`<ul>`}:
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'ul > li {'}<br />
            {'  /* Your list item styles here */'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>6. Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow you to target elements based on their state or position within the document. Examples include `:hover`, `:active`, `:first-child`, `::before`, and `::after`. For instance, to style links when a user hovers over them:
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'a:hover {'}<br />
            {'  /* Your hover styles here */'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>7. Attribute Selectors:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Attribute selectors target elements with specific attributes and attribute values. For example, to style all input elements with a `type` attribute of "text":
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'input[type="text"] {'}<br />
            {'  /* Your input styles here */'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Attribute selectors are versatile and useful for styling elements based on their characteristics.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>8. Combinators:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Combinators are used to combine multiple selectors to create complex selection rules. Common combinators include the space (descendant selector), {`>`} (child selector), and `+` (adjacent sibling selector). They provide powerful ways to target specific elements in a document's structure.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'header + section {'}<br />
            {'  /* Styles for a section immediately following a header */'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Understanding and using CSS selectors effectively empowers web designers and developers to create beautifully styled web pages with precision. Selectors play a crucial role in achieving the desired layout and visual presentation.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>Current CSS Practices:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          CSS selectors continued to evolve with new features and capabilities. Selectors like `:not()`, `:nth-child()`, and `:nth-of-type()` became more prevalent, providing even greater control over element targeting.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Additionally, the adoption of CSS preprocessors like Sass and LESS allowed for the use of variables, mixins, and nested selectors, making CSS code more maintainable and reusable.
        </p>

        <p className='my-3'>
          It's essential for web developers to stay updated with the latest CSS selector techniques and best practices to enhance their ability to create modern and responsive web designs.

        <h1 className='text-4xl font-bold'>CSS Display Property: Controlling Element Rendering</h1>

        <p className='my-3'>
          The CSS `display` property is a fundamental and versatile tool for controlling how HTML elements are rendered on a web page. It influences the layout, visibility, and behavior of elements, allowing web developers to achieve specific design goals. Let's dive into the various values of the `display` property and their practical applications.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>1. Block-level Elements:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Block-level elements, such as {`<div>`}, {`<p>`}, {`<h1>`}, and {`<ul>`}, have a default `display` value of `block`. This means they generate a block-level box, occupying the full width of their parent container and stacking vertically. Block-level elements are often used for structural elements and content separation.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'div {'}<br />
            {'  display: block;'}<br />

          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>2. Inline Elements:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Inline elements, such as {`<span>`}, {`<a>`}, {`<strong>`}, and {`<em>`} , have a default `display` value of `inline`. They flow within the text content, taking up only as much width as necessary. Inline elements do not create line breaks and are often used for text-level elements and links.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'a {'}<br />
            {'  display: inline;'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>3. Inline-Block Elements:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          The `display` value `inline-block` combines characteristics of both block-level and inline elements. Elements with this value create a box that flows inline but can have block-level properties like setting a width and height or margins. It's often used for creating horizontal lists or navigation menus.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'li {'}<br />
            {'  display: inline-block;'}<br />

          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>4. None:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Setting the `display` value to `none` hides the element from the layout entirely. It's as if the element doesn't exist in the document flow. This property is commonly used for creating toggling effects or hiding elements conditionally with JavaScript.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'#hidden-element {'}<br />
            {'  display: none;'}<br />

          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>5. Flex and Grid:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          The `display` property can also be set to `flex` or `grid`, enabling powerful layout options through CSS Flexbox and Grid Layout. These values allow for precise control over the arrangement and alignment of child elements within their parent containers.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'#flex-container {'}<br />
            {'  display: flex;'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>

        <h1 className='text-4xl font-bold'>CSS Positioning: Controlling Element Placement</h1>

        <p className='my-3'>
          The CSS `position` property is a powerful tool for controlling the placement and positioning of HTML elements within their containing elements. It allows web developers to precisely control the layout and positioning of elements on a web page. Let's explore the various values of the `position` property and their practical applications.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>1. Static (Default):</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Elements with the `position: static;` property have the default behavior. They are positioned in the normal document flow, and their position is determined by the page's layout algorithm. This is the default value and doesn't require specifying the `position` property.
        </p>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>2. Relative:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Elements with `position: relative;` are positioned relative to their normal position in the document flow. You can use the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to offset the element from its original position.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'#relative-box {'}<br />
            {'  position: relative;'}<br />
            {'  top: 20px;'}<br />
            {'  left: 10px;'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>3. Absolute:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Elements with `position: absolute;` are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor, which means you need to have a parent element with `position` set to `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`. Absolute positioning removes the element from the normal document flow, so other elements will not be affected by it.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'#absolute-box {'}<br />
            {'  position: absolute;'}<br />
            {'  top: 0;'}<br />
            {'  right: 0;'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>4. Fixed:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Elements with `position: fixed;` are positioned relative to the viewport, meaning they remain in the same position even when the page is scrolled. This is commonly used for elements like navigation bars that should stay at the top of the page.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'#fixed-navbar {'}<br />
            {'  position: fixed;'}<br />
            {'  top: 0;'}<br />
            {'  left: 0;'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>5. Sticky:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Elements with `position: sticky;` are positioned based on the user's scroll position. They behave like `relative` positioning until they reach a specified offset from the top (or bottom) of their containing element or the viewport. Sticky positioning is commonly used for headers or sidebars that should stick to the top or side of the screen as the user scrolls.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'#sticky-sidebar {'}<br />
            {'  position: sticky;'}<br />
            {'  top: 20px;'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>6. Z-Index:</h2>

        <p className='my-3'>
          The `z-index` property is used in combination with `position: relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky` to control the stacking order of elements. Elements with higher `z-index` values appear on top of elements with lower values.
        </p>

        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'#higher-z-index {'}<br />
            {'  position: relative;'}<br />
            {'  z-index: 2;'}<br />
            {'}'}
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p className='my-3'>
          Understanding the `position` property and its values allows web developers to create complex and responsive layouts, ensuring that elements are placed exactly where they are intended to be on the web page.

        <h1 className='text-4xl font-bold'>Introduction to CSS Flexbox: Building Flexible Layouts</h1>
    
        <p className='my-3'>
          CSS Flexbox, or Flexible Box Layout, is a powerful layout model in CSS that makes it easier to design complex and responsive web layouts. It provides a more efficient way to distribute space and align content in a container, even when the container's size is unknown or dynamic. Let's explore the key concepts and features of Flexbox.
        </p>
    
        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>1. Flex Containers and Items:</h2>
    
        <p className='my-3'>
          In Flexbox, you work with two main components: the <strong>flex container</strong> and the <strong>flex items</strong>. The container is a parent element that contains one or more child items. By applying Flexbox properties to the container, you control how its child items are laid out.
        </p>
    
        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>2. Main and Cross Axes:</h2>
    
        <p className='my-3'>
          Flexbox introduces two axes: the <strong>main axis</strong> and the <strong>cross axis</strong>. The main axis is determined by the <code>flex-direction</code> property (e.g., row or column), while the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. Understanding these axes is essential for controlling item alignment and distribution.
        </p>
    
        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>3. Flex Container Properties:</h2>
    
        <p className='my-3'>
          Flex containers have several properties to customize their behavior. Some important ones include <code>display: flex</code> to create a flex container, <code>flex-direction</code> to set the main axis direction, and <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-items</code> to control alignment along the main and cross axes, respectively.
        </p>
    
        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'.flex-container {'}<br />

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>4. Flex Item Properties:</h2>
    
        <p className='my-3'>
          Flex items can also have specific properties. The <code>flex</code> property determines how much space an item takes relative to other items. You can use <code>order</code> to control the visual order of items and <code>align-self</code> to override the container's alignment for a specific item.
        </p>
    
        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'.flex-item {'}<br />
            {'  flex: 1;'}<br />
            {'  order: 2;'}<br />

        <p className='my-3'>
          At its core, a Media Query is a CSS rule that selectively applies styles to HTML elements based on specific conditions. These conditions are primarily related to the characteristics of the device or screen where the web content is displayed. For instance, you can use a Media Query to define different styles for screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels. This means that when a user accesses your website on a device with a smaller screen, the layout and styling will adjust automatically to ensure readability and accessibility.
        </p>
    
        <pre className='my-3'>
          <code>
            {'@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {'}<br />
            {'  /* Styles for screens with a maximum width of 768px */'}<br />
            {'}'}

          CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap and Foundation, provide pre-designed UI components and layout structures to expedite web development.

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>3. CSS Methodologies</h2>
    
        <p className='my-3'>
          CSS methodologies, like BEM (Block Element Modifier) and SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS), offer guidelines and best practices for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable CSS code. These methodologies advocate for a structured approach to CSS organization, making it easier to collaborate on projects and avoid style conflicts.

        <h2 className='text-3xl font-bold my-3'>4. CSS-in-JS</h2>
    
        <p className='my-3'>
          CSS-in-JS is a modern approach to styling in which CSS is written using JavaScript. Libraries like styled-components and Emotion enable you to define component-specific styles directly within your JavaScript code. CSS-in-JS enhances component encapsulation and allows for dynamic styles based on props and states.

        <p className='my-3'>
          CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools that provide precise control over the positioning and alignment of elements in web layouts. Understanding the capabilities and differences between these layout systems is crucial for creating responsive and complex web designs efficiently.
