     ```

   ## Environment Variables

To run **LEARN WITH FUN!**, you'll need to set up certain environment variables in the `.env` files for both the "Client" and "Server" directories. Here's how to obtain these values:

1. **PORT=3001**: You can choose any available port for your server, but it's commonly set to 3001. Make sure the client and server `.env` files have the same port.

2. **MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas URI>**: To obtain the MongoDB URI, follow these steps:
   - Sign in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - Create a new cluster or use an existing one.
   - In the cluster dashboard, click "Connect."
   - Choose "Connect your application."
   - Copy the provided connection string, which includes placeholders for your username and password.
   - Replace `<Your MongoDB Atlas URI>` in the server `.env` file with this connection string and make sure to add your actual MongoDB Atlas username and password.

3. **PASSWORD=<Your Google App Password>**: If you're using Gmail for sending emails, you'll need to generate an "App Password." Here's how:
   - Go to your Google Account settings.
   - Navigate to "Security" and find the "App passwords" section.
   - Generate a new app password for your application. This password is what you'll use for the `PASSWORD` value in the server `.env` file.

4. **GMAIL_ID=<Your Gmail ID>**: This is simply your Gmail email address that you're using to send emails.

5. **JWT_SECRET_KEY=<Your Secret Key>**: You can choose any secure string as your secret key. Make sure it's a strong and unique value.

Make sure to replace the placeholders `<Your MongoDB Atlas URI>`, `<Your Google App Password>`, `<Your Gmail ID>`, and `<Your Secret Key>` with your actual values in the respective `.env` files.


Now you have successfully set up the environment variables required to run **LEARN WITH FUN!**. Continue with the installation process to launch the application.


5. **Run the Application**:
